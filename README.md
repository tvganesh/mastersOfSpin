# MastersOfSpin
This project analyzes the masters of spin bowling in cricket namely 
- Shane Warne
- Muthian Muralitharan 
- Anil Kumble
The wickets frequency and the average economy rate is computed and plotted.
Finally all the 3 spinners are compared against one another to see who is the 'king of spin'
